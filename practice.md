# Welcome to my GitHub Markdown Practice Document

Here is a paragraph with a **bolded** word and a _italicized_ word

~~This line is a mistake~~

**This text is _important_ since it's all bold**

***This text is extremely important since it's all bold and italics***

This is some <sub>subscript</sub> text

This is some <sup>superscript</sup> text

Here is a couple interesting quotes

---
> What doesn't kill you, simply makes you, stranger.
---
<p>- Joker (The Dark Knight)</p>

---
> Happiness is not the absence of problems. It's the ability to deal with them.

<p>- Steve Maraboli</p>
